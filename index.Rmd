# Introduction
In this project we will analyse data from a quantified self project, in which 6 participants try to quantify how well do they perform an activity rather than how much of the activity they do.
Participants  were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways, and data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell were recorded. See more info on the [Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset.](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)

We will use the [training dataset from here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv) and the [testing dataset from here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

We will predict the manner in which they did the exercise, through analysing the "classe" variable in the training set, and use a prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 

# Get and clean the data
## 1. Data sources
```{r}
f.training <- 'pml-training.csv'
f.test     <- 'pml-test.csv'
u.training  <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv'
u.test      <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv'
```
## 2. Download the data
```{r download, eval=FALSE}
download.file(u.training, f.training, method='curl')
download.file(u.test,     f.test,     method='curl')
```
## 3. Clean and preprocess the data
Read and explore the datasets
```{r}
tr <- read.csv(f.training, na.strings = c("", "NA", "#DIV/0!"))
te <- read.csv(f.test, na.strings = c("", "NA", "#DIV/0!"))
```
There are many empty variables (NA) and some variables that are clearly irrelevant. Remove these.
```{r}
d.tr <- tr[ , colSums(is.na(tr)) == 0]
d.te <- te[, colSums(is.na(te)) == 0]
d.tr <- d.tr[, -c(1:7)]
d.te <- d.te[, -c(1:7)]
```
# Model building
Slice the data into training and testing sets

```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(13579) 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(d.tr$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
training <- d.tr[inTrain, ]
testing <- d.tr[-inTrain, ]
```

Use a tree to classify the data

```{r}
treeFit <- train(classe ~ .,method="rpart",data=training)
print(treeFit$finalModel)
```


The decision tree is not so good.
```{r}
treePred <- predict(treeFit, type = "class")
table(training$classe, treePred)
```

Let's have a look at a pruned version (the tree has too many nodes to be plotted with enough clarity)
```{r}
pruned.t <- prune.misclass(treefit, best = 10)
plot(pruned.t)
title(main = "Figure 1: Tree created using tree function")
text(pruned.t, cex = 1.2)
```

```{r}
good = table(treePred == training$classe)
in.error = as.vector(100 * (1 - good["TRUE"]/sum(good)))
```
The in-sample error is **`r in.error` %**




modFit <- train(classe~ .,data=training,method="rf",prox=TRUE)
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
